Introduction
============

Code for bika.veterinary is rooted in this folder.

The root of all configuration is the configure.zcml file.  Reading this file
is the quickest way to discover what's available in the system, which URLs
are mapped to which views, and which adapters have been configured.

overrides.zcml performs the same task, but handles the case where a zcml
directive is identical to one in the base bika.health package.  In this case,
adding the directive in a normal zcml file will result in a configuration
error.  The root overrides.zcml is reponsible for including all other
overrides in this package.

Items in this folder
====================

- adapters/

    Customisations to bika.health adapters.  Adapters can be located anywhere
    in the system, making them possibly quite hard to discover unless they
    are documented.  I prefer to keep them located here, inside packages
    named after their function, especially if they are general-purpose adapters
    which can be applied to more than one content type.  It's perfectly OK to
    splatter them around the source in any way you like, though.
    
- browser/

    Contains browser views, both new ones and those which are subclassed
    from the base bika.health package and overridden in overrides.zcml.
 
- content/

    Any new content types (AT or Dexterity classes) should be created in this
    folder.  Read the Plone docs for information on creating new AT or 
    Dexterity objects; nothing special here.
